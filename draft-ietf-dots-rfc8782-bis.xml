      <t>This document specifies the Distributed Denial-of-Service Open Threat
      Signaling (DOTS) signal channel, a protocol for signaling the need for
      protection against Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks to a
      server capable of enabling network traffic mitigation on behalf of the
      requesting client.</t>

      <t>A companion document defines the DOTS data channel, a separate

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a distributed
      attempt to make machines or network resources unavailable to their
      intended users. In most cases, sufficient scale for an effective attack
      can be achieved by compromising enough end hosts and using those
      infected hosts to perpetrate and amplify the attack. The victim in this
      attack can be an application server, a host, a router, a firewall, or an
      entire network.</t>

      <t>Network applications have finite resources like CPU cycles, the
      number of processes or threads they can create and use, the maximum
      number of simultaneous connections they can handle, the resources
      assigned to the control plane, etc. When processing network traffic,
      such applications are supposed to use these resources to provide the
      intended functionality in the most efficient manner. However, a DDoS
      attacker may be able to prevent an application from performing its
      intended task by making the application exhaust its finite
      resources.</t>

      <t>A TCP DDoS SYN flood <xref target="RFC4987"></xref>, for example, is
      a memory-exhausting attack while an ACK flood is a CPU-exhausting
      attack. Attacks on the link are carried out by sending enough traffic so
      that the link becomes congested, thereby likely causing packet loss for
      legitimate traffic. Stateful firewalls can also be attacked by sending
      traffic that causes the firewall to maintain an excessive number of
      states that may jeopardize the firewall's operation overall, in addition
      to likely performance impacts. The firewall then runs out of memory, and
      it can no longer instantiate the states required to process legitimate
      flows. Other possible DDoS attacks are discussed in <xref
      target="RFC4732"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In many cases, it may not be possible for network administrators to
      determine the cause(s) of an attack. They may instead just realize that
      certain resources seem to be under attack. This document defines a
      lightweight protocol that allows a DOTS client to request mitigation
      from one or more DOTS servers for protection against detected,
      suspected, or anticipated attacks. This protocol enables cooperation
      between DOTS agents to permit a highly automated network defense that is
      robust, reliable, and secure. Note that "secure" means the support of
      the features defined in Section 2.4 of <xref
      target="RFC8612"></xref>.</t>

      <t>In typical deployments, the DOTS client belongs to a different
      administrative domain than the DOTS server. For example, the DOTS client
      is embedded in a firewall protecting services owned and operated by a
      customer, while the DOTS server is owned and operated by a different
      administrative entity (service provider, typically) providing DDoS
      mitigation services. The latter might or might not provide connectivity
      services to the network hosting the DOTS client.</t>

      <t>The DOTS server may (not) be co-located with the DOTS mitigator. In
      typical deployments, the DOTS server belongs to the same administrative
      domain as the mitigator. The DOTS client can communicate directly with a
      DOTS server or indirectly via a DOTS gateway.</t>

      <t>An example of a network diagram that illustrates a deployment of DOTS
      agents is shown in <xref target="fig1"></xref>. In this example, a DOTS
      server is operating on the access network. A DOTS client is located on
      the LAN (Local Area Network), while a DOTS gateway is embedded in the
      CPE (Customer Premises Equipment).</t>

    <section title="Design Overview">
      <t>The DOTS signal channel is built on top of the Constrained
      Application Protocol (CoAP) <xref target="RFC7252"></xref>, a
      lightweight protocol originally designed for constrained devices and
      networks. The many features of CoAP (expectation of packet loss, support
      for asynchronous Non-confirmable messaging, congestion control, small
      message overhead limiting the need for fragmentation, use of minimal
      resources, and support for (D)TLS) make it a good candidate upon which
      to build the DOTS signaling mechanism.</t>

      <t>DOTS clients and servers behave as CoAP endpoints. By default, a DOTS
      client (or server) behaves as a CoAP client (or server). Nevertheless, a
      DOTS client (or server) behaves as a CoAP server (or client) for
      specific operations such as DOTS heartbeat operations (<xref
      target="hb"></xref>).</t>

      <t>The DOTS signal channel is layered on existing standards (see <xref
      target="fig_dots"></xref>).</t>

        </figure></t>

      <t>In some cases, a DOTS client and server may have a mutual agreement
      to use a specific port number, such as by explicit configuration or
      dynamic discovery <xref target="RFC8973"></xref>. Absent such mutual
      agreement, the DOTS signal channel MUST run over port number 4646 as
      defined in <xref target="port"></xref>, for both UDP and TCP (that is,
      the DOTS server listens on port number 4646). In order to use a distinct
      port number (as opposed to 4646), DOTS clients and servers SHOULD
      support a configurable parameter to supply the port number to
      use.<figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[      |  Note: The rationale for not using the default port number 5684
      |  ((D)TLS CoAP) is to avoid the discovery of services and
      |  resources discussed in [RFC7252] and allow for differentiated
      |  behaviors in environments where both a DOTS gateway and an
      |  Internet of Things (IoT) gateway (e.g., Figure 3 of [RFC7452])
      |  are co-located.
      |  
      |  Particularly, the use of a default port number is meant to
      |  simplify DOTS deployment in scenarios where no explicit IP
      |  address configuration is required.  For example, the use of the
      |  default router as the DOTS server aims to ease DOTS deployment
      |  within LANs (in which CPEs embed a DOTS gateway as illustrated
      |  in Figures 1 and 2) without requiring a sophisticated discovery
      |  method and configuration tasks within the LAN.  It is also
      |  possible to use anycast addresses for DOTS servers to simplify
      |  DOTS client configuration, including service discovery.  In
      |  such an anycast-based scenario, a DOTS client initiating a DOTS
      |  session to the DOTS server anycast address may, for example, be
      |  (1) redirected to the DOTS server unicast address to be used by
      |  the DOTS client following the procedure discussed in
      |  Section 4.6 or (2) relayed to a unicast DOTS server.]]></artwork>
        </figure></t>

      <t>The signal channel uses the "coaps" URI scheme defined in Section 6
      of <xref target="RFC7252"></xref> and the "coaps+tcp" URI scheme defined
      in Section 8.2 of <xref target="RFC8323"></xref> to identify DOTS server
      resources that are accessible using CoAP over UDP secured with DTLS and
      CoAP over TCP secured with TLS, respectively.</t>

      <t>The DOTS signal channel can be established between two DOTS agents
      prior to or during an attack. The DOTS signal channel is initiated by
      the DOTS client. The DOTS client can then negotiate, configure, and
      retrieve the DOTS signal channel session behavior with its DOTS peer
      (<xref target="sigconfig"></xref>). Once the signal channel is
      established, the DOTS agents may periodically send heartbeats to keep
      the channel active (<xref target="hb"></xref>). At any time, the DOTS
      client may send a mitigation request message (<xref
      target="m_req"></xref>) to a DOTS server over the active signal channel.
      While mitigation is active (because of the higher likelihood of packet
      loss during a DDoS attack), the DOTS server periodically sends status
      messages to the client, including basic mitigation feedback details.
      Mitigation remains active until the DOTS client explicitly terminates
      mitigation or the mitigation lifetime expires. Also, the DOTS server may
      rely on the signal channel session loss to trigger mitigation for
      preconfigured mitigation requests (if any).</t>

      <t>DOTS signaling can happen use DTLS over UDP and TLS over TCP.
      Likewise, DOTS requests may be sent using IPv4 or IPv6 transfer
      capabilities. A Happy Eyeballs procedure for the DOTS signal channel is
      specified in <xref target="HE"></xref>.</t>

      <t>A DOTS client is entitled to access only the resources it creates. In
      particular, a DOTS client cannot retrieve data related to mitigation
      requests created by other DOTS clients of the same DOTS client
      domain.</t>

      <t>Messages exchanged between DOTS agents are serialized using Concise
      Binary Object Representation (CBOR) <xref target="RFC8949"></xref>, a
      binary encoding scheme designed for small code and message size.
      CBOR-encoded payloads are used to carry signal channel-specific payload
      messages that convey request parameters and response information such as
      errors. In order to allow the reusing of data models across protocols,
      <xref target="RFC7951"></xref> specifies the JavaScript Object Notation
      (JSON) encoding of YANG-modeled data. A similar effort for CBOR is
      defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor"></xref>.</t>

      <t>DOTS agents determine that a CBOR data structure is a DOTS signal
      channel object from the application context, such as from the port
      number assigned to the DOTS signal channel. The other method DOTS agents
      use to indicate that a CBOR data structure is a DOTS signal channel
      object is the use of the "application/dots+cbor" content type (<xref
      target="MediaReg"></xref>).</t>

      <t>This document specifies a YANG module for representing DOTS
      mitigation scopes, DOTS signal channel session configuration data, and
      DOTS redirected signaling (<xref target="YANG"></xref>). All parameters
      in the payload of the DOTS signal channel are mapped to CBOR types as
      specified in <xref target="mapping">Table 5</xref>.</t>

      <t>In order to prevent fragmentation, DOTS agents must follow the
      recommendations documented in Section 4.6 of <xref
      target="RFC7252"></xref>. Refer to <xref target="mtu"></xref> for more
      details.</t>

      <t>DOTS agents MUST support GET, PUT, and DELETE CoAP methods. The
      payload included in CoAP responses with 2.xx Response Codes MUST be of
      content type "application/dots+cbor". CoAP responses with 4.xx and 5.xx
      error Response Codes MUST include a diagnostic payload (Section 5.5.2 of
      <xref target="RFC7252"></xref>). The diagnostic payload may contain
      additional information to aid troubleshooting.</t>

      <t>In deployments where multiple DOTS clients are enabled in a single
      network and administrative domain (called, DOTS client domain), the DOTS
      server may detect conflicting mitigation requests from these clients.
      This document does not aim to specify a comprehensive list of conditions
      under which a DOTS server will characterize two mitigation requests from
      distinct DOTS clients as conflicting, nor does it recommend a DOTS
      server behavior for processing conflicting mitigation requests. Those
      considerations are implementation and deployment specific. Nevertheless,
      this document specifies the mechanisms to notify DOTS clients when
      conflicts occur, including the conflict cause (<xref
      target="m_req"></xref>).</t>

      <t>In deployments where one or more translators (e.g., Traditional NAT
      <xref target="RFC3022"></xref>, CGN <xref target="RFC6888"></xref>,
      NAT64 <xref target="RFC6146"></xref>, NPTv6 <xref
      target="RFC6296"></xref>) are enabled between the client's network and
      the DOTS server, any DOTS signal channel messages forwarded to a DOTS
      server MUST NOT include internal IP addresses/prefixes and/or port
      numbers; instead, external addresses/prefixes and/or port numbers as
      assigned by the translator MUST be used. This document does not make any
      recommendations about possible translator discovery mechanisms. The
      following are some (non-exhaustive) deployment examples that may be
      considered: <list style="symbols">
          <t hangText="*">Port Control Protocol (PCP) <xref
          target="RFC6887"></xref> or Session Traversal Utilities for NAT
          (STUN) <xref target="RFC8489"></xref> may be used by the client to
          retrieve the external addresses/prefixes and/or port numbers.
          Information retrieved by means of PCP or STUN will be used to feed
          the DOTS signal channel messages that will be sent to a DOTS
          server.</t>

          <t>A DOTS gateway may be co-located with the translator. The DOTS
          gateway will need to update the DOTS messages based upon the local
          translator's binding table.</t>
        </list></t>

      <section anchor="back" title="Backward Compatibility Considerations">
        <t>The main changes to <xref target="RFC8782"></xref> are listed in
        <xref target="changes"></xref>. These modifications are made with the
        constraint to avoid changes to the mapping table defined in Table 5 of
        <xref target="RFC8782"></xref> (see also <xref
        target="mapping"></xref>). For both legacy and implementations that
        follow the present specification, a DOTS signal channel attribute will
        thus have the same CBOR key value and CBOR major type. The only
        upgrade that is required to <xref target="RFC8782"></xref>
        implementations is to handle the CBOR key value range "128-255" as
        comprehension-optional instead of comprehension-required. Note that
        this range is anticipated to be used by the DOTS telemetry <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-telemetry"></xref> in which the following means
        are used to prevent message processing failure of a DOTS signal
        channel message enriched with telemetry data: (1) DOTS agents use
        dedicated (new) path suffixes (Section 5 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-telemetry"></xref>) and (2) a DOTS server won't
        include telemetry attributes in its responses unless it is explicitly
        told to do so by a DOTS client (Section 6.1.2 of <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-dots-telemetry"></xref>).</t>

        <t>Future DOTS extensions that request a CBOR value in the range
        "128-255" must support means similar to the aforementioned DOTS
        telemetry ones.</t>

      <section anchor="HE" title="Happy Eyeballs for DOTS Signal Channel">
        <t><xref target="RFC8612"></xref> mentions that DOTS agents will have
        to support both connectionless and connection-oriented protocols. As
        such, the DOTS signal channel is designed to operate with DTLS over
        UDP and TLS over TCP. Further, a DOTS client may acquire a list of
        IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (<xref target="discover"></xref>), each of
        which can be used to contact the DOTS server using UDP and TCP. If no
        list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to contact the DOTS server is
        configured (or discovered), the DOTS client adds the IPv4/IPv6
        addresses of its default router to the candidate list to contact the
        DOTS server.</t>

        <t>The following specifies the procedure to follow to select the
        address family and the transport protocol for sending DOTS signal
        channel messages.</t>

        <t>Such a procedure is needed to avoid experiencing long connection
        delays. For example, if an IPv4 path to a DOTS server is functional,
        but the DOTS server's IPv6 path is nonfunctional, a dual-stack DOTS
        client may experience a significant connection delay compared to an
        IPv4-only DOTS client in the same network conditions. The other
        problem is that if a middlebox between the DOTS client and DOTS server
        is configured to block UDP traffic, the DOTS client will fail to
        establish a DTLS association with the DOTS server; consequently, it
        will have to fall back to TLS over TCP, thereby incurring significant
        connection delays.</t>

        <t>To overcome these connection setup problems, the DOTS client
        attempts to connect to its DOTS server(s) using both IPv6 and IPv4,
        and it tries both DTLS over UDP and TLS over TCP following a DOTS
        Happy Eyeballs approach. To some extent, this approach is similar to
        the Happy Eyeballs mechanism defined in [RFC8305]. The connection
        attempts are performed by the DOTS client when it initializes or, in
        general, when it has to select an address family and transport to
        contact its DOTS server. The results of the Happy Eyeballs procedure
        are used by the DOTS client for sending its subsequent messages to the
        DOTS server. The differences in behavior with respect to the Happy
        Eyeballs mechanism [RFC8305] are listed below:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>The order of preference of the DOTS signal channel address
            family and transport protocol (most preferred first) is the
            following: UDP over IPv6, UDP over IPv4, TCP over IPv6, and
            finally TCP over IPv4. This order adheres to the address
            preference order specified in [RFC6724] and the DOTS signal
            channel preference that promotes the use of UDP over TCP (to avoid
            TCP's head of line blocking).</t>

            <t>After successfully establishing a connection, the DOTS client
            MUST cache information regarding the outcome of each connection
            attempt for a specific time period; it uses that information to
            avoid thrashing the network with subsequent attempts. The cached
            information is flushed when its age exceeds a specific time period
            on the order of few minutes (e.g., 10 min). Typically, if the DOTS
            client has to reestablish the connection with the same DOTS server
            within a few seconds after the Happy Eyeballs mechanism is
            completed, caching avoids thrashing the network especially in the
            presence of DDoS attack traffic.</t>

            <t>If a DOTS signal channel session is established with TLS (but
            DTLS failed), the DOTS client periodically repeats the mechanism
            to discover whether DOTS signal channel messages with DTLS over
            UDP become available from the DOTS server; this is so the DOTS
            client can migrate the DOTS signal channel from TCP to UDP. Such
            probing SHOULD NOT be done more frequently than every 24 hours and
            MUST NOT be done more frequently than every 5 minutes.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t><!--
-->When connection attempts are made during an attack, the DOTS client SHOULD
        use a "Connection Attempt Delay" <xref target="RFC8305"></xref> set to
        100 ms.</t>

        <t>In <xref target="fig_happy_eyeballs"></xref>, the DOTS client
        proceeds with the connection attempts following the rules in <xref
        target="RFC8305"></xref>. In this example, it is assumed that the IPv6
        path is broken and UDP traffic is dropped by a middlebox, but this has
        little impact on the DOTS client because there is not a long delay
        before using IPv4 and TCP.</t>

        <t>DOTS agents MUST NOT send more than one UDP datagram per round-trip

        <t>Requests marked by the DOTS client as Non-confirmable messages are
        sent at regular intervals until a response is received from the DOTS
        server. If the DOTS client cannot maintain an RTT estimate, it MUST

        SHOULD use an even less aggressive rate whenever possible (case 2 in
        Section 3.1.3 of <xref target="RFC8085"></xref>). Mitigation requests

            <t>When a DOTS client requires mitigation for some reason, the

            <t>If a DOTS client is entitled to solicit the DOTS service, the

            communicating the DOTS client's request to a mitigator (which may
            be co-located with the DOTS server) and relaying the feedback of
            the thus-selected mitigator to the requesting DOTS client.</t>

            <t>The order of the Uri-Path options is important as it defines
            the CoAP resource. In particular, 'mid' MUST follow 'cuid'.</t>

            <t>The additional Uri-Path parameters to those defined in <xref
            target="uri-path"></xref> are as follows:</t>

            <t><list hangIndent="6" style="hanging">
                <t hangText="cuid:">Stands for Client Unique Identifier. A
                globally unique identifier that is meant to prevent collisions
                among DOTS clients, especially those from the same domain. It
                MUST be generated by DOTS clients.<vspace blankLines="1" />For
                the reasons discussed in Appendix A, implementations SHOULD
                set 'cuid' using the following procedure: first, the DOTS
                client inputs one of the following into the SHA-256 [RFC6234]
                cryptographic hash: the DER-encoded ASN.1 representation of
                the Subject Public Key Info (SPKI) of its X.509 certificate
                [RFC5280], its raw public key [RFC7250], the "Pre-Shared Key
                (PSK) identity" it uses in the TLS 1.2 ClientKeyExchange
                message, or the "identity" it uses in the "pre_shared_key" TLS
                1.3 extension. Then, the output of the cryptographic hash
                algorithm is truncated to 16 bytes; truncation is done by
                stripping off the final 16 bytes. The truncated output is
                base64url encoded (Section 5 of [RFC4648]) with the two
                trailing "=" removed from the encoding, and the resulting
                value used as the 'cuid'. <vspace blankLines="1" />The 'cuid'
                is intended to be stable when communicating with a given DOTS
                server, i.e., the 'cuid' used by a DOTS client SHOULD NOT
                change over time. Distinct 'cuid' values MAY be used by a
                single DOTS client per DOTS server. <vspace
                blankLines="1" />If a DOTS client has to change its 'cuid' for
                some reason, it MUST NOT do so when mitigations are still
                active for the old 'cuid'. The 'cuid' SHOULD be 22 characters
                to avoid DOTS signal message fragmentation over UDP.
                Furthermore, if that DOTS client created aliases and filtering
                entries at the DOTS server by means of the DOTS data channel,
                it MUST delete all the entries bound to the old 'cuid' and
                reinstall them using the new 'cuid'.<vspace
                blankLines="1" />DOTS servers MUST return 4.09 (Conflict)
                error code to a DOTS peer to notify that the 'cuid' is already
                in use by another DOTS client. Upon receipt of that error
                code, a new 'cuid' MUST be generated by the DOTS peer (e.g.,
                using <xref target="RFC4122"></xref>). <vspace
                blankLines="1" />Client-domain DOTS gateways MUST handle
                'cuid' collision directly and it is RECOMMENDED that 'cuid'
                collision is handled directly by server-domain DOTS
                gateways.<vspace blankLines="1" />DOTS gateways MAY rewrite
                the 'cuid' used by peer DOTS clients. Triggers for such
                rewriting are out of scope. <vspace blankLines="1" />This is a

                represented with an integer. This identifier MUST be unique
                for each mitigation request bound to the DOTS client, i.e.,
                the 'mid' parameter value in the mitigation request needs to
                be unique (per 'cuid' and DOTS server) relative to the 'mid'
                parameter values of active mitigation requests conveyed from
                the DOTS client to the DOTS server.<vspace blankLines="1" />In
                order to handle out-of-order delivery of mitigation requests,

                - 1) (i.e., 3221225471) and no attack is detected, the DOTS
                client MUST reset 'mid' to 0 to handle 'mid' rollover. If the
                DOTS client maintains mitigation requests with preconfigured
                scopes, it MUST recreate them with the 'mid' restarting at

                of the "PSK identity" in the 'cdid', following the same rules

            to mitigate the attack. A DOTS server MAY reject mitigation
            requests when it is near capacity or needs to rate-limit a
            particular client, for example.</t>

            <t>The relative order of two mitigation requests with the same
            'trigger- mitigation' type from a DOTS client is determined by
            comparing their respective 'mid' values. If two mitigation
            requests with the same 'trigger-mitigation' type have overlapping
            mitigation scopes, the mitigation request with the highest numeric
            'mid' value will override the other mitigation request. Two
            mitigation requests from a DOTS client have overlapping scopes if
            there is a common IP address, IP prefix, FQDN, URI, or alias. To
            avoid maintaining a long list of overlapping mitigation requests
            (i.e., requests with the same 'trigger-mitigation' type and
            overlapping scopes) from a DOTS client and to avoid error-prone
            provisioning of mitigation requests from a DOTS client, the
            overlapped lower numeric 'mid' MUST be automatically deleted and
            no longer available at the DOTS server. For example, if the DOTS
            server receives a mitigation request that overlaps with an
            existing mitigation with a higher numeric 'mid', the DOTS server
            rejects the request by returning 4.09 (Conflict) to the DOTS
            client. The response MUST include enough information for a DOTS
            client to recognize the source of the conflict as described below
            in the 'conflict-information' subtree with only the relevant nodes
            listed:</t>

            <t>If the DOTS server receives a mitigation request that overlaps
            with an active mitigation request, but both have distinct
            'trigger- mitigation' types, the DOTS server SHOULD deactivate
            (absent explicit policy/configuration otherwise) the mitigation
            request with 'trigger- mitigation' set to 'false'. Particularly,
            if the mitigation request with 'trigger-mitigation' set to 'false'
            is active, the DOTS server withdraws the mitigation request (i.e.,
            status code is set to '7' as defined in Table 3) and transitions
            the status of the mitigation request to '8'.</t>

            <t>Upon DOTS signal channel session loss with a peer DOTS client,
            the DOTS server SHOULD withdraw (absent explicit
            policy/configuration otherwise) any active mitigation requests
            that overlap with mitigation requests having 'trigger-mitigation'
            set to 'false' from that DOTS client, as the loss of the session
            implicitly activates these preconfigured mitigation requests, and
            they take precedence. Note that the active-but-terminating period
            is not observed for mitigations withdrawn at the initiative of the
            DOTS server.</t>

            <t>DOTS clients may adopt various strategies for setting the
            scopes of immediate and preconfigured mitigation requests to avoid
            potential conflicts. For example, a DOTS client may tweak
            preconfigured scopes so that the scope of any overlapping
            immediate mitigation request will be a subset of the preconfigured
            scopes. Also, if an immediate mitigation request overlaps with any
            of the preconfigured scopes, the DOTS client sets the scope of the
            overlapping immediate mitigation request to be a subset of the
            preconfigured scopes, so as to get a broad mitigation when the
            DOTS signal channel collapses and to maximize the chance of
            recovery.</t>

            <t>If the request conflicts with an existing mitigation request
            from a different DOTS client, the DOTS server may return 2.01
            (Created) or 4.09 (Conflict) to the requesting DOTS client. If the
            DOTS server decides to maintain the new mitigation request, the
            DOTS server returns 2.01 (Created) to the requesting DOTS client.
            If the DOTS server decides to reject the new mitigation request,
            the DOTS server returns 4.09 (Conflict) to the requesting DOTS
            client. For both 2.01 (Created) and 4.09 (Conflict) responses, the
            response MUST include enough information for a DOTS client to

          The Size2 Option may be conveyed in the response to indicate the

          the rest of the representation by sending additional GET requests
          with Block2 Options containing NUM values greater than zero. The
          DOTS client MUST adhere to the block size preferences indicated by
          the DOTS server in the response. If the DOTS server uses the Block2
          Option in the GET response, and the response is for a dynamically
          changing resource (e.g., "c=n" or "c=a" query), the DOTS server MUST

          <section anchor="obs" title="DOTS Servers Sending Mitigation Status">
            <t>The Observe Option defined in <xref target="RFC7641"></xref>
            extends the CoAP core protocol with a mechanism for a CoAP client
            to "observe" a resource on a CoAP server: the client retrieves a
            representation of the resource and requests this representation be
            updated by the server as long as the client is interested in the
            resource. DOTS implementations MUST support the Observe Option for
            both 'mitigate' and 'config' (<xref
            target="uri-path"></xref>).</t>

            <t>A DOTS client conveys the Observe Option set to '0' in the GET
            request to receive asynchronous notifications of attack mitigation
            status from the DOTS server.</t>

            <t>Unidirectional mitigation notifications within the
            bidirectional signal channel enables asynchronous notifications
            between the agents. <xref target="RFC7641"></xref> indicates that
            (1) a notification can be sent in a Confirmable or a
            Non-confirmable message, and (2) the message type used is
            typically application dependent and may be determined by the
            server for each notification individually. For the DOTS server
            application, the message type MUST always be set to
            Non-confirmable even if the underlying COAP library elects a
            notification to be sent in a Confirmable message. This overrides
            the behavior defined in Section 4.5 of <xref
            target="RFC7641"></xref> to send a Confirmable message instead of
            a Non-confirmable message at least every 24 hours for the
            following reasons: First, the DOTS signal channel uses a heartbeat
            mechanism to determine if the DOTS client is alive. Second,
            Confirmable messages are not suitable during an attack.</t>

            <t>Due to the higher likelihood of packet loss during a DDoS
            attack, the DOTS server periodically sends attack mitigation
            status to the DOTS client and also notifies the DOTS client
            whenever the status of the attack mitigation changes. If the DOTS
            server cannot maintain an RTT estimate, it MUST NOT send more than
            one asynchronous notification every 3 seconds, and SHOULD use an
            even less aggressive rate whenever possible (case 2 in Section
            3.1.3 of <xref target="RFC8085"></xref>).</t>

            <t>When conflicting requests are detected, the DOTS server
            enforces the corresponding policy (e.g., accept all requests,
            reject all requests, accept only one request but reject all the
            others). It is assumed that this policy is supplied by the DOTS
            server administrator or that it is a default behavior of the DOTS
            server implementation. Then, the DOTS server sends a notification
            message(s) to the DOTS client(s) at the origin of the conflict
            (refer to the conflict parameters defined in <xref
            target="post"></xref>). A conflict notification message includes
            information about the conflict cause, scope, and the status of the
            mitigation request(s). For example:<list style="symbols">
                <t>A notification message with 'status' code set to '7 (Attack
                mitigation is withdrawn)' and 'conflict-status' set to '1' is
                sent to a DOTS client to indicate that an active mitigation
                request is deactivated because a conflict is detected.</t>

                <t>A notification message with 'status' code set to '1 (Attack
                mitigation is in progress)' and 'conflict-status' set to '2'
                is sent to a DOTS client to indicate that this mitigation
                request is in progress, but a conflict is detected.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>Upon receipt of a conflict notification message indicating that
            a mitigation request is deactivated because of a conflict, a DOTS
            client MUST NOT resend the same mitigation request before the
            expiry of 'retry-timer'. It is also recommended that DOTS clients
            support the means to alert administrators about mitigation
            conflicts.</t>

            <t>A DOTS client that is no longer interested in receiving
            notifications from the DOTS server can simply "forget" the
            observation. When the DOTS server sends the next notification, the
            DOTS client will not recognize the token in the message and, thus,
            will return a Reset message. This causes the DOTS server to remove
            the associated entry. Alternatively, the DOTS client can
            explicitly de-register itself by issuing a GET request that has
            the Token field set to the token of the observation to be canceled
            and includes an Observe Option with the value set to '1'
            (de-register). The latter is more deterministic and, thus, is
            RECOMMENDED.</t>

            <t><xref target="Figure6"></xref> shows an example of a DOTS
            client requesting a DOTS server to send notifications related to a
            mitigation request. Note that for mitigations with preconfigured
            scopes (i.e., 'trigger-mitigation' set to 'false'), the state will
            need to transition from 3 (attack-stopped) to 8
            (attack-mitigation-signal-loss).</t>

          <section title="DOTS Clients Polling for Mitigation Status">
            <t>The DOTS client can send the GET request at frequent intervals
            without the Observe Option to retrieve the configuration data of
            the mitigation request and non-configuration data (i.e., the
            attack status). DOTS clients MAY be configured with a policy
            indicating the frequency of polling DOTS servers to get the
            mitigation status. This frequency MUST NOT be more than one UDP
            datagram per RTT as discussed in Section 3.1.3 of <xref
            target="RFC8085"></xref>.</t>

            <t>If the DOTS server has been able to mitigate the attack and the
            attack has stopped, the DOTS server indicates as such in the
            status. In such case, the DOTS client withdraws the mitigation
            request by issuing a DELETE request for this mitigation request
            (<xref target="del"></xref>).</t>

            <t>A DOTS client SHOULD react to the status of the attack per the
            information sent by the DOTS server rather than performing its own
            detection that the attack has been mitigated. This ensures that
            the DOTS client does not withdraw a mitigation request prematurely
            because it is possible that the DOTS client does not sense the
            DDoS attack on its resources, but the DOTS server could be
            actively mitigating the attack because the attack is not
            completely averted.</t>

        </section>

        <section anchor="put" title="Efficacy Update from DOTS Clients">
          <t>While DDoS mitigation is in progress, due to the likelihood of
          packet loss, a DOTS client MAY periodically transmit DOTS mitigation
          efficacy updates to the relevant DOTS server. A PUT request is used
          to convey the mitigation efficacy update to the DOTS server. This
          PUT request is treated as a refresh of the current mitigation.</t>

          <t>The 'attack-status' parameter is a mandatory attribute when
          performing an efficacy update. The various possible values contained
          in the 'attack-status' parameter are described in Table 4.</t>

            </figure></t>

          <t>The PUT request used for the efficacy update MUST include all the
          parameters used in the PUT request to carry the DOTS mitigation
          request (<xref target="post"></xref>) unchanged apart from the
          'lifetime' parameter value. If this is not the case, the DOTS server
          MUST reject the request with a 4.00 (Bad Request). </t>

          <t>The If-Match Option (Section 5.10.8.1 of <xref
          target="RFC7252"></xref>) with an empty value is used to make the
          PUT request conditional on the current existence of the mitigation
          request. If UDP is used as transport, CoAP requests may arrive out
          of order. For example, the DOTS client may send a PUT request to
          convey an efficacy update to the DOTS server followed by a DELETE
          request to withdraw the mitigation request, but the DELETE request
          arrives at the DOTS server before the PUT request. To handle
          out-of-order delivery of requests, if an If-Match Option is present
          in the PUT request and the 'mid' in the request matches a mitigation
          request from that DOTS client, the request is processed by the DOTS
          server. If no match is found, the PUT request is silently ignored by
          the DOTS server.</t>

          gateways, as specified in <xref target="post"></xref>, MUST be
          followed for DELETE requests. Uri-Path parameters with empty values

          <t>If the DELETE request does not include 'cuid' and 'mid'
          parameters, the DOTS server MUST reply with a 4.00 (Bad
          Request).</t>

          <t>Once the request is validated, the DOTS server immediately
          acknowledges a DOTS client's request to withdraw the DOTS mitigation
          request using 2.02 (Deleted) Response Code with no response payload.
          A 2.02 (Deleted) Response Code is returned even if the 'mid'
          parameter value conveyed in the DELETE request does not exist in its
          configuration data before the request.</t>

          <t>If the DOTS server finds the 'mid' parameter value conveyed in
          the DELETE request in its configuration data for the DOTS client,
          then to protect against route or DNS flapping caused by a DOTS
          client rapidly removing a mitigation, and to dampen the effect of
          oscillating attacks, the DOTS server MAY allow mitigation to
          continue for a limited period after acknowledging a DOTS client's
          withdrawal of a mitigation request. During this period, the DOTS
          server status messages SHOULD indicate that mitigation is active but
          terminating (<xref target="get"></xref>).</t>

          <t>The initial active-but-terminating period SHOULD be sufficiently
          long to absorb latency incurred by route propagation. The
          active-but-terminating period SHOULD be set by default to 120
          seconds. If the client requests mitigation again before the initial
          active-but-terminating period elapses, the DOTS server MAY
          exponentially increase (the base of the exponent is 2) the
          active-but-terminating period up to a maximum of 300 seconds (5
          minutes).</t>

          <t>Once the active-but-terminating period elapses, the DOTS server
          MUST treat the mitigation as terminated, as the DOTS client is no
          longer responsible for the mitigation.</t>

          <t>If a mitigation is triggered due to a signal channel loss, the
          DOTS server relies upon normal triggers to stop that mitigation
          (typically, receipt of a valid DELETE request, expiry of the
          mitigation lifetime, or scrubbing the traffic to the attack target).
          In particular, the DOTS server MUST NOT consider the signal channel
          recovery as a trigger to stop the mitigation.</t>

               title="DOTS Signal Channel Session Configuration">
        <t>A DOTS client can negotiate, configure, and retrieve the DOTS
        signal channel session behavior with its DOTS peers. The DOTS signal
        channel can be used, for example, to configure the following:<list
            style="letters">
            <t>Heartbeat interval ('heartbeat-interval'): DOTS agents
            regularly send heartbeats to each other after mutual
            authentication is successfully completed in order to keep the DOTS
            signal channel open. Heartbeat messages are exchanged between DOTS
            agents every 'heartbeat-interval' seconds to detect the current
            status of the DOTS signal channel session.</t>

            <t>Missing heartbeats allowed ('missing-hb-allowed'): This
            variable indicates the maximum number of consecutive heartbeat
            messages for which a DOTS agent did not receive a response before
            concluding that the session is disconnected or defunct.</t>

            <t>Acceptable probing rate ('probing-rate'): This parameter
            indicates the average data rate that must not be exceeded by a
            DOTS agent in sending to a peer DOTS agent that does not
            respond.</t>

            <t>Acceptable signal loss ratio: Maximum retransmissions
            ('max-retransmit'), retransmission timeout value ('ack-timeout'),
            and other message transmission parameters for Confirmable messages
            over the DOTS signal channel.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>When the DOTS signal channel is established over a reliable
        transport (e.g., TCP), there is no need for the reliability mechanisms
        provided by CoAP over UDP since the underlying TCP connection provides
        retransmissions and deduplication <xref target="RFC8323"></xref>. As a
        reminder, CoAP over reliable transports does not support Confirmable
        or Non-confirmable message types. As such, the transmission-related
        parameters ('missing-hb-allowed' and acceptable signal loss ratio) are
        negotiated only for DOTS over unreliable transports.</t>

        <t>The same or distinct configuration sets may be used during times
        when a mitigation is active ('mitigating-config') and when no
        mitigation is active ('idle-config'). This is particularly useful for
        DOTS servers that might want to reduce heartbeat frequency or cease
        heartbeat exchanges when an active DOTS client has not requested
        mitigation. If distinct configurations are used, DOTS agents MUST
        follow the appropriate configuration set as a function of the
        mitigation activity (e.g., if no mitigation request is active (also
        referred to as 'idle' time), values related to 'idle-config' must be
        followed). Additionally, DOTS agents MUST automatically switch to the
        other configuration upon a change in the mitigation activity (e.g., if
        an attack mitigation is launched after an 'idle' time, the DOTS agent
        switches from values related to 'idle-config' to values related to
        'mitigating-config').</t>

        <t>CoAP requests and responses are indicated for reliable delivery by
        marking them as Confirmable messages. DOTS signal channel session
        configuration requests and responses are marked as Confirmable
        messages. As explained in Section 2.1 of <xref
        target="RFC7252"></xref>, a Confirmable message is retransmitted using
        a default timeout and exponential backoff between retransmissions,
        until the DOTS server sends an Acknowledgement message (ACK) with the
        same Message ID conveyed from the DOTS client.</t>

        <t>Message transmission parameters are defined in Section 4.8 of <xref
        target="RFC7252"></xref>. The DOTS server can either piggyback the
        response in the Acknowledgement message or, if the DOTS server cannot
        respond immediately to a request carried in a Confirmable message, it
        simply responds with an Empty Acknowledgement message so that the DOTS
        client can stop retransmitting the request. Empty Acknowledgement
        messages are explained in Section 2.2 of <xref
        target="RFC7252"></xref>. When the response is ready, the server sends
        it in a new Confirmable message, which, in turn, needs to be
        acknowledged by the DOTS client (see Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 of <xref
        target="RFC7252"></xref>). Requests and responses exchanged between
        DOTS agents during 'idle' time, except heartbeat messages, are marked
        as Confirmable messages.</t>

          <artwork><![CDATA[      |  Implementation Note: A DOTS client that receives a response in
      |  a Confirmable message may want to clean up the message state

      |  server retransmits the Confirmable message, the DOTS client may
      |  no longer have any state that would help it correlate this
      |  response: from the DOTS client's standpoint, the retransmission
      |  message is unexpected.  The DOTS client will send a Reset
      |  message so it does not receive any more retransmissions.  This

          RECOMMENDED specific DOTS transmission parameter values are
          'heartbeat-interval' (30 seconds) and 'missing-hb-allowed' (15).</t>

          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[      |  Note: 'heartbeat-interval' should be tweaked to also assist
      |  DOTS messages for NAT traversal (SIG-011 of [RFC8612]).
      |  According to [RFC8085], heartbeat messages must not be sent
      |  more frequently than once every 15 seconds and should use
      |  longer intervals when possible.  Furthermore, [RFC4787]
      |  recommends that NATs use a state timeout of 2 minutes or
      |  longer, but experience shows that sending packets every 15 to
      |  30 seconds is necessary to prevent the majority of middleboxes
      |  from losing state for UDP flows.  From that standpoint, the
      |  RECOMMENDED minimum 'heartbeat-interval' is 15 seconds and the
      |  RECOMMENDED maximum 'heartbeat-interval' is 240 seconds.  The
      |  recommended value of 30 seconds is selected to anticipate the
      |  expiry of NAT state.
      |  
      |  A 'heartbeat-interval' of 30 seconds may be considered to be
      |  too chatty in some deployments.  For such deployments, DOTS
      |  agents may negotiate longer 'heartbeat-interval' values to
      |  prevent any network overload with too frequent heartbeats.
      |  
      |  Different heartbeat intervals can be defined for 'mitigating-
      |  config' and 'idle-config' to reduce being too chatty during
      |  idle times.  If there is an on-path translator between the DOTS
      |  client (standalone or part of a DOTS gateway) and the DOTS
      |  server, the 'mitigating-config' 'heartbeat-interval' has to be
      |  smaller than the translator session timeout.  It is recommended
      |  that the 'idle-config' 'heartbeat-interval' also be smaller
      |  than the translator session timeout to prevent translator
      |  traversal issues or that it be disabled entirely.  Means to
      |  discover the lifetime assigned by a translator are out of
      |  scope.
      |  
      |  Given that the size of the heartbeat request cannot exceed
      |  ('heartbeat-interval' * 'probing-rate') bytes, 'probing-rate'
      |  should be set appropriately to avoid slowing down heartbeat
      |  exchanges.  For example, 'probing-rate' may be set to 2 *
      |  ("size of encrypted DOTS heartbeat request"/'heartbeat-
      |  interval') or (("size of encrypted DOTS heartbeat request" +
      |  "average size of an encrypted mitigation request")/'heartbeat-

          with a configuration it sends. This feature allows the update of the
          configuration data if a change occurs at the DOTS server side. For
          example, the new configuration may instruct a DOTS client to cease

          <t>It is NOT RECOMMENDED to return a Max-Age Option set to 0.</t>

          <t>Returning a Max-Age Option set to 2^(32)-1 is equivalent to

          <t>If a non-zero value of Max-Age Option is received by a DOTS

          to retrieve the current and acceptable configuration before the
          expiry of the value enclosed in the Max-Age Option. This request is
          considered by the client and the server to be a means to refresh the
          configuration parameters for the signal channel. When a DDoS attack
          is active, refresh requests MUST NOT be sent by DOTS clients, and
          the DOTS server MUST NOT terminate the (D)TLS session after the
          expiry of the value returned in Max-Age Option.</t>

          <t>If Max-Age Option is not returned in a response, the DOTS client
          initiates GET requests to refresh the configuration parameters each
          60 seconds (Section 5.10.5 of <xref target="RFC7252"></xref>). To
          prevent such overload, it is RECOMMENDED that DOTS servers return a
          Max-Age Option in GET responses. Considerations related to which

          session. A (D)TLS session is terminated by the receipt of an

            attribute.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The DOTS server returns the Time to Live (TTL) of the alternate
        DOTS server in a Max-Age Option. That is, the time interval that the
        alternate DOTS server may be cached for use by a DOTS client. A Max-
        Age Option set to 2^(32)-1 is equivalent to receiving an infinite TTL.
        This value means that the alternate DOTS server is to be used until
        the alternate DOTS server redirects the traffic with another 5.03
        response that conveys an alternate server's FQDN.</t>

        <t>A Max-Age Option set to '0' may be returned for redirecting
        mitigation requests. Such a value means that the redirection applies
        only for the mitigation request in progress. Returning short TTL in a
        Max-Age Option may adversely impact DOTS clients on slow links.
        Returning short values should be avoided under such conditions.</t>

        <t>If the alternate DOTS server TTL has expired, the DOTS client MUST
        use the DOTS server(s) that was provisioned using means discussed in
        <xref target="discover"></xref>. This fallback mechanism is triggered
        immediately upon expiry of the TTL, except when a DDoS attack is

        <t>When the DOTS client receives a 5.03 response with an alternate
        server included, it considers the current request to have failed, but
        it SHOULD try resending the request to the alternate DOTS server.
        During a DDoS attack, the DNS server may be the target of another DDoS
        attack, the alternate DOTS server's IP addresses conveyed in the 5.03
        response help the DOTS client skip the DNS lookup of the alternate
        DOTS server, at the cost of trusting the first DOTS server to provide
        accurate information. The DOTS client can then try to establish a UDP
        or a TCP session with the alternate DOTS server. The DOTS client MAY
        implement a method to construct IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses <xref
        target="RFC6052"></xref>; this is required to handle the scenario
        where an IPv6-only DOTS client communicates with an IPv4-only
        alternate DOTS server.</t>

        <t>If the DOTS client has been redirected to a DOTS server with which
        it has already communicated within the last five (5) minutes, it MUST
        ignore the redirection and try to contact other DOTS servers listed in
        the local configuration or discovered using dynamic means such as DHCP
        or SRV procedures <xref target="RFC8973"></xref>. It is RECOMMENDED
        that DOTS clients support the means to alert administrators about
        redirect loops.</t>

      <section anchor="hb" title="Heartbeat Mechanism">
        <t>To provide an indication of signal health and to distinguish an
        'idle' signal channel from a 'disconnected' or 'defunct' session, the
        DOTS agent sends a heartbeat over the signal channel to maintain its
        half of the channel (also, aligned with the "consents" recommendation
        in Section 6 of <xref target="RFC8085"></xref>). The DOTS agent
        similarly expects a heartbeat from its peer DOTS agent, and it may
        consider a session terminated in the prolonged absence of a peer agent
        heartbeat. Concretely, while the communication between the DOTS agents
        is otherwise quiescent, the DOTS client will probe the DOTS server to
        ensure it has maintained cryptographic state and vice versa. Such
        probes can also keep the bindings of firewalls and/or stateful
        translators alive. This probing reduces the frequency of establishing
        a new handshake when a DOTS signal needs to be conveyed to the DOTS
        server.</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[      |  Implementation Note: Given that CoAP roles can be multiplexed
      |  over the same session as discussed in [RFC7252] and are already
      |  supported by CoAP implementations, both the DOTS client and
      |  server can send DOTS heartbeat requests.]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t>The DOTS heartbeat mechanism uses Non-confirmable PUT requests
        (<xref target="hbreq"></xref>) with an expected 2.04 (Changed)
        Response Code (<xref target="hbrep"></xref>). This procedure occurs
        between a DOTS agent and its immediate peer DOTS agent. As such, this
        PUT request MUST NOT be relayed by a DOTS gateway. The PUT request
        used for DOTS heartbeat MUST NOT have a 'cuid', 'cdid', or 'mid'
        Uri-Path.</t>

        heartbeat messages from its peer in the last (2 * 'heartbeat-
        interval') period. Such information can be used by a peer DOTS agent
        to detect or confirm connectivity issues and react accordingly. For
        example, if a DOTS client receives a 2.04 response for its heartbeat
        messages but no server-initiated heartbeat messages, the DOTS client
        sets 'peer-hb-status' to 'false' in its next heartbeat message. Upon
        receipt of this message, the DOTS server then will need to try another
        strategy for sending the heartbeats (e.g., adjust the heartbeat
        interval or send a server-initiated heartbeat immediately after
        receiving a client-initiated heartbeat message).</t>

        <t>DOTS servers MAY trigger their heartbeat requests immediately after

        'missing-hb-allowed' number of consecutive heartbeat messages, it
        concludes that the DOTS signal channel session is disconnected. The
        DOTS client MUST then try to reestablish the DOTS signal channel
        session, preferably by resuming the (D)TLS session.</t>

        <figure align="center">
          <artwork align="center"><![CDATA[  |  Note: If a new DOTS signal channel session cannot be
  |  established, the DOTS client SHOULD NOT retry to establish the
  |  DOTS signal channel session more frequently than every 300
  |  seconds (5 minutes) and MUST NOT retry more frequently than
  |  every 60 seconds (1 minute).  It is recommended that DOTS

        <t>In case of a massive DDoS attack that saturates the incoming
        link(s) to the DOTS client, all traffic from the DOTS server to the
        DOTS client will likely be dropped, although the DOTS server receives
        heartbeat requests in addition to DOTS messages sent by the DOTS
        client. In this scenario, DOTS clients MUST behave differently to
        handle message transmission and DOTS signal channel session liveliness
        during link saturation:</t>

        <t><list style="empty">
            <t>The DOTS client MUST NOT consider the DOTS signal channel
            session terminated even after a maximum 'missing-hb-allowed'
            threshold is reached. The DOTS client SHOULD keep on using the
            current DOTS signal channel session to send heartbeat requests
            over it, so that the DOTS server knows the DOTS client has not
            disconnected the DOTS signal channel session. <vspace
            blankLines="1" />After the maximum 'missing-hb-allowed' threshold
            is reached, the DOTS client SHOULD try to establish a new DOTS
            signal channel session. The DOTS client SHOULD send mitigation
            requests over the current DOTS signal channel session and, in
            parallel, send the mitigation requests over the new DOTS signal
            channel session. This may be handled, for example, by resumption
            of the (D)TLS session or using 0-RTT mode in DTLS 1.3 to piggyback
            the mitigation request in the ClientHello message.</t>

            <t><vspace blankLines="1" />As soon as the link is no longer
            saturated, if traffic from the DOTS server reaches the DOTS client
            over the current DOTS signal channel session, the DOTS client can
            stop the new DOTS signal channel session attempt or if a new DOTS
            signal channel session is successful then disconnect the current
            DOTS signal channel session.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>If the DOTS server receives traffic from the peer DOTS client
        (e.g., peer DOTS client-initiated heartbeats) but the maximum
        'missing-hb- allowed' threshold is reached, the DOTS server MUST NOT
        consider the DOTS signal channel session disconnected. The DOTS server
        MUST keep on using the current DOTS signal channel session so that the
        DOTS client can send mitigation requests over the current DOTS signal
        channel session. In this case, the DOTS server can identify that the
        DOTS client is under attack and that the inbound link to the DOTS
        client (domain) is saturated. Furthermore, if the DOTS server does not
        receive a mitigation request from the DOTS client, it implies that the
        DOTS client has not detected the attack or, if an attack mitigation is
        in progress, it implies that the applied DDoS mitigation actions are
        not yet effectively handling the DDoS attack volume.</t>

        <t>If the DOTS server does not receive any traffic from the peer DOTS
        client during the time span required to exhaust the maximum
        'missing-hb-allowed' threshold, the DOTS server concludes the session
        is disconnected. The DOTS server can then trigger preconfigured
        mitigation requests for this DOTS client (if any).</t>

        <t>In DOTS over TCP, the sender of a DOTS heartbeat message has to
        allow up to 'heartbeat-interval' seconds when waiting for a heartbeat
        reply. When a failure is detected by a DOTS client, it proceeds with
        the session recovery, following the same approach as the one used for
        unreliable transports.</t>

    <section anchor="mapping" title="YANG/JSON Mapping Parameters to CBOR">
      <t>All parameters in the payload of the DOTS signal channel MUST be
      mapped to CBOR types as shown in Table 5 and are assigned an integer key
      to save space. <list style="empty">
          <t>Note: Implementers must check that the mapping output provided by
          their YANG-to-CBOR encoding schemes is aligned with the content of
          Table 5. For example, some CBOR and JSON types for enumerations and
          the 64-bit quantities can differ depending on the encoder used.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The CBOR key values are divided into two types:
      comprehension-required and comprehension-optional. DOTS agents can
      safely ignore comprehension-optional values they don't understand, but
      they cannot successfully process a request if it contains
      comprehension-required values that are not understood. The 4.00 response
      SHOULD include a diagnostic payload describing the unknown
      comprehension-required CBOR key values. The initial set of CBOR key
      values defined in this specification are of type
      comprehension-required.</t>

    <section anchor="profile"
             title="(D)TLS Protocol Profile and Performance Considerations">
      <section title="(D)TLS Protocol Profile">
        <t>This section defines the (D)TLS protocol profile of DOTS signal
        channel over (D)TLS and DOTS data channel over TLS.</t>

        <t>There are known attacks on (D)TLS, such as man-in-the-middle and
        protocol downgrade attacks. These are general attacks on (D)TLS and,
        as such, they are not specific to DOTS over (D)TLS; refer to the
        (D)TLS RFCs for discussion of these security issues. DOTS agents MUST
        adhere to the (D)TLS implementation recommendations and security
        considerations of <xref target="RFC7525"></xref> except with respect
        to (D)TLS version. Because DOTS signal channel encryption relying upon
        (D)TLS is virtually a greenfield deployment, DOTS agents MUST
        implement only (D)TLS 1.2 or later.</t>

        <t>When a DOTS client is configured with a domain name of the DOTS
        server, and it connects to its configured DOTS server, the server may
        present it with a PKIX certificate. In order to ensure proper
        authentication, a DOTS client MUST verify the entire certification
        path per <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>. Additionally, the DOTS client
        MUST use <xref target="RFC6125"></xref> validation techniques to
        compare the domain name with the certificate provided. Certification
        authorities that issue DOTS server certificates SHOULD support the
        DNS-ID and SRV-ID identifier types. DOTS servers SHOULD prefer the use
        of DNS-ID and SRV-ID over CN-ID identifier types in certificate
        requests (as described in Section 2.3 of <xref
        target="RFC6125"></xref>), and the wildcard character '*' SHOULD NOT
        be included in the presented identifier. DOTS doesn't use URI-IDs for
        server identity verification.</t>

        <t>A key challenge to deploying DOTS is the provisioning of DOTS
        clients, including the distribution of keying material to DOTS clients
        to enable the required mutual authentication of DOTS agents.
        Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) <xref target="RFC7030"></xref>
        defines a method of certificate enrollment by which domains operating
        DOTS servers may provide DOTS clients with all the necessary
        cryptographic keying material, including a private key and a
        certificate, to authenticate themselves. One deployment option is to
        have DOTS clients behave as EST clients for certificate enrollment
        from an EST server provisioned by the mitigation provider. This
        document does not specify which EST or other mechanism the DOTS client
        uses to achieve initial enrollment.</t>

        <t>The Server Name Indication (SNI) extension <xref
        target="RFC6066"></xref> defines a mechanism for a client to tell a
        (D)TLS server the name of the server it wants to contact. This is a
        useful extension for hosting environments where multiple virtual
        servers are reachable over a single IP address. The DOTS client may or

        <t>Implementations compliant with this profile SHOULD implement all of

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>TLS False Start <xref target="RFC7918"></xref>, which reduces
            round-trips by allowing the TLS client's second flight of messages
            (ChangeCipherSpec) to also contain the DOTS signal. TLS False
            Start is formally defined for use with TLS, but the same technique
            is applicable to DTLS as well.</t>

            <t>Cached Information Extension <xref target="RFC7924"></xref>
            which avoids transmitting the server's certificate and certificate

          </list></t>

        <t>Compared to UDP, DOTS signal channel over TCP requires an
        additional round-trip time (RTT) of latency to establish a TCP
        connection. DOTS implementations are encouraged to implement TCP Fast
        Open <xref target="RFC7413"></xref> to eliminate that RTT.</t>

      <section anchor="DTLS" title="(D)TLS 1.3 Considerations">
        <t>TLS 1.3 provides useful latency improvements for connection
        establishment over TLS 1.2. The DTLS 1.3 protocol <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13"></xref> is based upon the TLS 1.3
        protocol and provides equivalent security guarantees. (D)TLS 1.3
        provides two basic handshake modes the DOTS signal channel can take
        advantage of:</t>

        <t><list style="symbols">
            <t>A full handshake mode in which a DOTS client can send a DOTS
            mitigation request message after one round trip and the DOTS
            server immediately responds with a DOTS mitigation response. This
            assumes no packet loss is experienced.</t>

            <t>0-RTT mode in which the DOTS client can authenticate itself and
            send DOTS mitigation request messages in the first message, thus
            reducing handshake latency. 0-RTT only works if the DOTS client
            has previously communicated with that DOTS server, which is very
            likely with the DOTS signal channel.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The DOTS client has to establish a (D)TLS session with the DOTS
        server during 'idle' time and share a PSK.</t>

        <t>During a DDoS attack, the DOTS client can use the (D)TLS session to
        convey the DOTS mitigation request message and, if there is no
        response from the server after multiple retries, the DOTS client can
        resume the (D)TLS session in 0-RTT mode using PSK.</t>

        <t>DOTS servers that support (D)TLS 1.3 MAY allow DOTS clients to send
        early data (0-RTT). DOTS clients MUST NOT send "CoAP Ping" as early
        data; such messages MUST be rejected by DOTS servers. Section 8 of
        <xref target="RFC8446"></xref> discusses some mechanisms to implement
        in order to limit the impact of replay attacks on 0-RTT data. If the
        DOTS server accepts 0-RTT, it MUST implement one of these mechanisms
        to prevent replay at the TLS layer. A DOTS server can reject 0-RTT by
        sending a TLS HelloRetryRequest.</t>

        <t>The DOTS signal channel messages sent as early data by the DOTS
        client are idempotent requests. As a reminder, the Message ID (Section
        3 of <xref target="RFC7252"></xref>) is changed each time a new CoAP
        request is sent, and the Token (Section 5.3.1 of <xref
        target="RFC7252"></xref>) is randomized in each CoAP request. The DOTS
        server(s) MUST use the Message ID and the Token in the DOTS signal
        channel message to detect replay of early data at the application
        layer and accept 0-RTT data at most once from the same DOTS client.
        This anti-replay defense requires sharing the Message ID and the Token
        in the 0-RTT data between DOTS servers in the DOTS server domain. DOTS
        servers do not rely on transport coordinates to identify DOTS peers.
        As specified in <xref target="post"></xref>, DOTS servers couple the
        DOTS signal channel sessions using the DOTS client identity and
        optionally the 'cdid' parameter value. Furthermore, the 'mid' value is
        monotonically increased by the DOTS client for each mitigation
        request, thus attackers that replay mitigation requests with lower
        numeric 'mid' values and overlapping scopes with mitigation requests
        having higher numeric 'mid' values will be rejected systematically by
        the DOTS server. Likewise, the 'sid' value is monotonically increased
        by the DOTS client for each configuration request (<xref
        target="convey"></xref>); attackers replaying configuration requests
        with lower numeric 'sid' values will be rejected by the DOTS server if
        it maintains a higher numeric 'sid' value for this DOTS client.</t>

        <t>Owing to the aforementioned protections, all DOTS signal channel
        requests are safe to transmit in TLS 1.3 as early data. Refer to <xref
        target="I-D.boucadair-dots-earlydata"></xref> for more details.</t>

      <section anchor="mtu" title="DTLS MTU and Fragmentation">
        <t>To avoid DOTS signal message fragmentation and the subsequent
        decreased probability of message delivery, DOTS agents MUST ensure
        that the DTLS record fits within a single datagram. As a reminder,
        DTLS handles fragmentation and reassembly only for handshake messages
        and not for the application data (Section 4.1.1 of <xref
        target="RFC6347"></xref>). If the path MTU (PMTU) cannot be
        discovered, DOTS agents MUST assume a PMTU of 1280 bytes, as IPv6
        requires that every link in the Internet have an MTU of 1280 octets or
        greater as specified in <xref target="RFC8200"></xref>. If IPv4
        support on legacy or otherwise unusual networks is a consideration and
        the PMTU is unknown, DOTS implementations MAY assume a PMTU of 576
        bytes for IPv4 datagrams (see Section 3.3.3 of <xref
        target="RFC1122"></xref>).</t>

        <t>The DOTS client must consider the amount of record expansion
        expected by the DTLS processing when calculating the size of the CoAP
        message that fits within the PMTU. PMTU MUST be greater than or equal
        to [CoAP message size + DTLS 1.2 overhead of 13 octets +
        authentication overhead of the negotiated DTLS cipher suite + block
        padding] (Section 4.1.1.1 of <xref target="RFC6347"></xref>). If the
        total request size exceeds the PMTU, then the DOTS client MUST split
        the DOTS signal into separate messages; for example, the list of
        addresses in the 'target-prefix' parameter could be split into
        multiple lists and each list conveyed in a new PUT request.</t>

             title="Mutual Authentication of DOTS Agents &amp; Authorization of DOTS Clients">
      <t>(D)TLS based upon client certificates can be used for mutual
      authentication between DOTS agents. If, for example, a DOTS gateway is
      involved, DOTS clients and DOTS gateways must perform mutual
      authentication; only authorized DOTS clients are allowed to send DOTS
      signals to a DOTS gateway. The DOTS gateway and the DOTS server must
      perform mutual authentication; a DOTS server only allows DOTS signal
      channel messages from an authorized DOTS gateway, thereby creating a
      two-link chain of transitive authentication between the DOTS client and
      the DOTS server.</t>

      <t>The DOTS server should support certificate-based client
      authentication. The DOTS client should respond to the DOTS server's TLS
      CertificateRequest message with the PKIX certificate held by the DOTS
      client. DOTS client certificate validation must be performed per
      [RFC5280], and the DOTS client certificate must conform to the [RFC5280]
      certificate profile. If a DOTS client does not support TLS client
      certificate authentication, it must support client authentication based
      on pre-shared key or raw public key.</t>

      <t>In the example depicted in <xref target="Figure12"></xref>, the DOTS
      gateway and DOTS clients within the 'example.com' domain mutually
      authenticate. After the DOTS gateway validates the identity of a DOTS
      client, it communicates with the AAA server in the 'example.com' domain
      to determine if the DOTS client is authorized to request DDoS
      mitigation. If the DOTS client is not authorized, a 4.01 (Unauthorized)
      is returned in the response to the DOTS client. In this example, the
      DOTS gateway only allows the application server and DDoS attack detector
      to request DDoS mitigation, but does not permit the user of type 'guest'
      to request DDoS mitigation.</t>

      <t>Also, DOTS gateways and servers located in different domains must
      perform mutual authentication (e.g., using certificates). A DOTS server
      will only allow a DOTS gateway with a certificate for a particular
      domain to request mitigation for that domain. In reference to <xref
      target="Figure12"></xref>, the DOTS server only allows the DOTS gateway
      to request mitigation for the 'example.com' domain and not for other
      domains.</t>

                  </figure><vspace blankLines="1" />Registration requests for
                the 16384-32767 range are evaluated after a three-week review
                period on the dots-signal-reg-review@ietf.org mailing list, on
                the advice of one or more Designated Experts. However, to
                allow for the allocation of values prior to publication, the
                Designated Experts may approve registration once they are
                satisfied that such a specification will be published. New
                registration requests should be sent in the form of an email
                to the review mailing list; the request should use an
                appropriate subject (e.g., "Request to register CBOR Key Value
                for DOTS: example"). IANA will only accept new registrations
                from the Designated Experts, and it will check that review was
                requested on the mailing list in accordance with these
                procedures.<vspace blankLines="1" />Within the review period,
                the Designated Experts will either approve or deny the
                registration request, communicating this decision to the
                review list and IANA. Denials should include an explanation
                and, if applicable, suggestions as to how to make the request
                successful. Registration requests that are undetermined for a
                period longer than 21 days can be brought to the IESG's
                attention (using the iesg@ietf.org mailing list) for
                resolution.<vspace blankLines="1" />Criteria that should be
                applied by the Designated Experts include determining whether
                the proposed registration duplicates existing functionality,
                whether it is likely to be of general applicability or whether
                it is useful only for a single use case, and whether the
                registration description is clear. IANA must only accept
                registry updates to the 16384-32767 range from the Designated
                Experts and should direct all requests for registration to the
                review mailing list. It is suggested that multiple Designated
                Experts be appointed. In cases where a registration decision
                could be perceived as creating a conflict of interest for a
                particular Expert, that Expert should defer to the judgment of
                the other Experts.</t>

        this note:<list style="empty">
            <t>Status, conflict status, conflict cause, and attack status
            values must not be directly added to the iana-dots-signal-channel

        <t>When a 'status', 'conflict-status', 'conflict-cause', or

        Codes", "DOTS Conflict Status Codes", "DOTS Conflict Cause Codes", or
        "DOTS Attack Status Codes" registry, a new "enum" statement must be

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>High-level DOTS security considerations are documented in <xref
      target="RFC8612"></xref> and <xref target="RFC8811"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Authenticated encryption MUST be used for data confidentiality and
      message integrity. The interaction between the DOTS agents requires
      Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) or Transport Layer Security
      (TLS) with a cipher suite offering confidentiality protection, and the
      guidance given in <xref target="RFC7525"></xref> MUST be followed to
      avoid attacks on (D)TLS. The (D)TLS protocol profile used for the DOTS
      signal channel is specified in <xref target="profile"></xref>.</t>

      <t>If TCP is used between DOTS agents, an attacker may be able to inject
      RST packets, bogus application segments, etc., regardless of whether TLS
      authentication is used. Because the application data is TLS protected,
      this will not result in the application receiving bogus data, but it
      will constitute a DoS on the connection. This attack can be countered by
      using TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) <xref target="RFC5925"></xref>.
      Although not widely adopted, if TCP-AO is used, then any bogus packets
      injected by an attacker will be rejected by the TCP-AO integrity check
      and therefore will never reach the TLS layer.</t>

      <t>If the 'cuid' is guessable, a misbehaving DOTS client from within the
      client's domain can use the 'cuid' of another DOTS client of the domain
      to delete or alter active mitigations. For this attack vector to happen,
      the misbehaving client needs to pass the security validation checks by
      the DOTS server, and eventually the checks of a client-domain DOTS
      gateway.</t>

      <t>A similar attack can be achieved by a compromised DOTS client that
      can sniff the TLS 1.2 handshake, use the client certificate to identify
      the 'cuid' used by another DOTS client. This attack is not possible if
      algorithms such as version 4 Universally Unique IDentifiers (UUIDs) in
      Section 4.4 of <xref target="RFC4122"></xref> are used to generate the
      'cuid' because such UUIDs are not a deterministic function of the client
      certificate. Likewise, this attack is not possible with TLS 1.3 because
      most of the TLS handshake is encrypted and the client certificate is not
      visible to eavesdroppers.</t>

      <t>A compromised DOTS client can collude with a DDoS attacker to send
      mitigation request for a target resource, get the mitigation efficacy
      from the DOTS server, and convey the mitigation efficacy to the DDoS
      attacker to possibly change the DDoS attack strategy. Obviously,
      signaling an attack by the compromised DOTS client to the DOTS server
      will trigger attack mitigation. This attack can be prevented by
      monitoring and auditing DOTS clients to detect misbehavior and to deter
      misuse, and by only authorizing the DOTS client to request mitigation
      for specific target resources (e.g., an application server is authorized
      to request mitigation for its IP addresses, but a DDoS mitigator can
      request mitigation for any target resource in the network). Furthermore,
      DOTS clients are typically co-located on network security services
      (e.g., firewall), and a compromised security service potentially can do
      a lot more damage to the network.</t>

      <t>Rate-limiting DOTS requests, including those with new 'cuid' values,
      from the same DOTS client defend against DoS attacks that would result
      in varying the 'cuid' to exhaust DOTS server resources. Rate-limit
      policies SHOULD be enforced on DOTS gateways (if deployed) and DOTS
      servers.</t>

      <t>In order to prevent leaking internal information outside a client's
      domain, DOTS gateways located in the client domain SHOULD NOT reveal the
      identification information that pertains to internal DOTS clients (e.g.,
      source IP address, client's hostname) unless explicitly configured to do
      so.</t>

      <t>DOTS servers MUST verify that requesting DOTS clients are entitled to
      trigger actions on a given IP prefix. That is, only actions on IP
      resources that belong to the DOTS client's domain MUST be authorized by
      a DOTS server. The exact mechanism for the DOTS servers to validate that
      the target prefixes are within the scope of the DOTS client domain is
      deployment specific.</t>

      <t>The presence of DOTS gateways may lead to infinite forwarding loops,
      which is undesirable. To prevent and detect such loops, this document
      uses the Hop-Limit Option.</t>

      <t>When FQDNs are used as targets, the DOTS server MUST rely upon DNS
      privacy-enabling protocols (e.g., DNS over TLS <xref
      target="RFC7858"></xref> or DNS over HTTPS (DoH) <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref>) to prevent eavesdroppers from possibly
      identifying the target resources protected by the DDoS mitigation
      service to ensure the target FQDN resolution is authentic (e.g., DNSSEC
      <xref target="RFC4034"></xref>).</t>

      <t>CoAP-specific security considerations are discussed in Section 11 of
      <xref target="RFC7252"></xref>, while CBOR-related security
      considerations are discussed in Section 10 of <xref
      target="RFC8949"></xref>.</t>

      <t>This document defines YANG data structures that are meant to be used
      as an abstract representation of DOTS signal channel messages. As such,
      the "ietf-dots-signal-channel" module does not introduce any new
      vulnerabilities beyond those specified above.</t>

    <section anchor="changes" title="Summary of Changes From RFC8782">
      <t>The main changes compared to <xref target="RFC8782"></xref> are as
      follows:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Update the "ietf-dots-signal-channel" YANG module (<xref
          target="yrequest"></xref>) and the tree structure (<xref
          target="tree"></xref>) to follow the new YANG data structure
          specified in <xref target="RFC8791"></xref>. In particular: <list
              style="symbols">
              <t>Add in 'choice' to indicate the communication direction in
              which a data node applies. If no 'choice' is indicated, a data
              node can appear in both directions (i.e., from DOTS clients to
              DOTS servers and vice versa).</t>

              <t>Remove 'config' clauses. Note that 'config' statements will
              be ignored (if present) anyway according to Section 4 of <xref
              target="RFC8791"></xref>. This supersedes the references to the
              use of 'ro' and 'rw' which are now covered by 'choice'
              above.</t>

              <t>Remove 'cuid', 'cdid', and 'sid' data nodes from the
              structure because these data nodes are included as Uri-Path
              options, not within the message body.</t>

              <t>Remove the list keys for the mitigation scope message type
              (i.e., 'cuid' and 'mid'). 'mid' is not indicated as a key
              because it is included as Uri-Path option for requests and in
              the message body for responses. Note that Section 4 of <xref
              target="RFC8791"></xref> specifies that a list does not require
              to have a key statement defined.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>Add a new section with a summary of the error code responses that
          can be returned by a DOTS server (<xref
          target="errors"></xref>).</t>

          <t>Update the IANA section to allocate a new range for
          comprehension-optional attributes (<xref target="format"></xref>).
          This modification is motivated by the need to allow for compact DOTS
          signal messages that include a long list of comprehension-optional
          attributes, e.g., DOTS telemetry messages <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dots-telemetry"></xref>.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t></t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="motiv" title="CUID Generation">
      <t>The document recommends the use of SPKI to generate the 'cuid'. This
      design choice is motivated by the following reasons:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>SPKI is globally unique.</t>

          <t>It is deterministic.</t>

          <t>It allows the avoidance of extra cycles that may be induced by
          'cuid' collision.</t>

          <t>DOTS clients do not need to store the 'cuid' in a persistent
          storage.</t>

          <t>It allows the detection of compromised DOTS clients that do not
          adhere to the 'cuid' generation algorithm.</t>
        </list></t>
